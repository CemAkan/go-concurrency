# Worker Pools

Worker pools are a concurrency pattern that maintains a fixed collection of worker goroutines to process tasks from a queue.

## Key Concepts

- **Fixed number of workers**: Controlling parallelism with a predetermined number of goroutines
- **Task queue**: Jobs are submitted to a queue for processing
- **Resource management**: Limiting resource usage with a bounded pool size
- **Reuse**: Worker goroutines are reused across multiple tasks

## Basic Pattern

```go
func WorkerPool(numWorkers int, tasks <-chan Task, results chan<- Result) {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    // Launch workers
    wg.Add(numWorkers)
    for i := 0; i < numWorkers; i++ {
        go func(workerID int) {
            defer wg.Done()
            for task := range tasks {
                result := process(task)
                results <- result
            }
        }(i)
    }
    
    // Wait for all workers to finish
    go func() {
        wg.Wait()
        close(results)
    }()
}
```

## Advantages Over Simple Fan-Out

- **Resource control**: Prevents unbounded resource consumption
- **Backpressure handling**: Natural backpressure when the task queue fills up
- **Separation of concerns**: Decouples task generation from processing
- **Predictable scaling**: Clear relationship between resources and concurrency

## Use Cases

- **Web servers**: Processing HTTP requests
- **Task schedulers**: Running background jobs
- **Data processing**: Processing large datasets
- **API gateways**: Managing calls to downstream services

## Variations

- **Dynamic pools**: Adjusting the number of workers based on load
- **Priority queues**: Processing high-priority tasks first
- **Specialized workers**: Different worker types for different tasks
- **Work stealing**: Workers can steal tasks from other workers' queues

## Challenges

- **Pool sizing**: Determining the optimal number of workers
- **Load balancing**: Ensuring fair distribution of work
- **Deadlocks**: Preventing situations where workers wait for each other
- **Error handling**: Managing failures in worker goroutines

## Exercise Ideas

1. Build a simple HTTP server with a worker pool for request handling
2. Create an image processing service with a worker pool
3. Implement a task scheduler with priority queues
4. Compare performance with different pool sizes

## Best Practices

- Size pools based on available resources and workload characteristics
- Use buffered channels for task queues to smooth spikes
- Implement graceful shutdown for worker pools
- Handle panics in worker goroutines
- Consider separate pools for CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks

## Common Mistakes

- Undersizing worker pools, limiting throughput
- Oversizing worker pools, wasting resources
- Not handling worker failures
- Not implementing timeouts for task processing
- Creating circular dependencies between worker pools

## Next Steps

After learning about worker pools, explore cancellation patterns to gracefully stop concurrent operations.
