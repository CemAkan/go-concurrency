# Distributed Concurrency

Distributed concurrency extends Go's concurrency model beyond a single machine, enabling coordinated execution across multiple servers, containers, or processes.

## Key Concepts

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Distributing workloads across multiple machines
- **State Management**: Maintaining shared state among distributed components
- **Message Passing**: Communication between distributed nodes
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handling node failures and network partitions
- **Consistency Models**: Different consistency guarantees for distributed data

## Distributed Patterns

### Distributed Worker Pools

Scaling worker pools across multiple machines.

```go
// Worker node code
func worker(jobQueue <-chan Job, results chan<- Result) {
    for job := range jobQueue {
        // Process job
        result := processJob(job)
        results <- result
    }
}
```

### Distributed Pub-Sub

Message distribution across multiple subscribers on different machines.

```go
// Publisher node using NATS, Redis, Kafka, etc.
func publishEvent(client pubsub.Client, topic string, event Event) error {
    data, err := json.Marshal(event)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return client.Publish(topic, data)
}

// Subscriber node
func subscribeToEvents(client pubsub.Client, topic string, handler func(Event)) error {
    return client.Subscribe(topic, func(msg []byte) {
        var event Event
        if err := json.Unmarshal(msg, &event); err != nil {
            log.Printf("Error unmarshaling event: %v", err)
            return
        }
        handler(event)
    })
}
```

### Distributed Locking

Coordinating access to shared resources across machines.

```go
// Using a distributed lock service like Redis, etcd, Consul, etc.
func withDistributedLock(client lockService, resourceID string, timeout time.Duration, fn func() error) error {
    lock, err := client.AcquireLock(resourceID, timeout)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to acquire lock: %w", err)
    }
    
    defer client.ReleaseLock(lock)
    
    return fn()
}
```

### Distributed Consensus

Making consistent decisions across a distributed system.

```go
// Using a consensus algorithm implementation like Raft (e.g., etcd)
func proposeValue(client consensusClient, key string, value string) error {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    
    _, err := client.Put(ctx, key, value)
    return err
}
```

## Common Distributed Middleware

- **Message Queues**: NATS, RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SQS
- **Distributed Caches**: Redis, Memcached
- **Consensus Systems**: etcd, Consul, Zookeeper
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd
- **API Gateways**: Envoy, Kong

## CAP Theorem

The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can have at most two of:
- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data at the same time
- **Availability**: The system continues to function despite node failures
- **Partition Tolerance**: The system functions despite network failures

Understanding these trade-offs is crucial for designing distributed systems.

## Distributed Concurrency Challenges

- **Network Latency**: Operations take longer due to network communication
- **Partial Failures**: Some nodes may fail while others continue
- **Consistency vs. Performance**: Strong consistency often requires performance trade-offs
- **Clock Synchronization**: Issues with distributed clocks and timing
- **Debugging Complexity**: Harder to trace issues across nodes

## Exercise Ideas

1. Build a distributed worker system using Redis as a queue
2. Create a chat system with multiple servers using NATS for message distribution
3. Implement leader election using etcd
4. Design a distributed rate limiter with Redis

## Best Practices

- Use idempotent operations for reliability
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Include distributed tracing for observability
- Design for graceful degradation during failures
- Consider eventual consistency where appropriate
- Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures

## Tools and Libraries

- **gRPC**: High-performance RPC framework
- **Protocol Buffers**: Efficient serialization format
- **OpenTracing/OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing
- **Go Cloud**: Portable cloud APIs
- **Temporal**: Workflow engine for reliable execution

## Next Steps

After understanding distributed concurrency, explore advanced concurrency patterns that combine multiple techniques for solving complex real-world problems.
