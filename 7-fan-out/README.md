# Fan-Out Pattern

The Fan-Out pattern is a concurrency design pattern where multiple goroutines read from a single channel, distributing work across multiple workers for parallel processing.

## Key Concepts

- **Distribution**: Spreading work across multiple goroutines
- **Parallelism**: Processing data in parallel to improve throughput
- **Load Balancing**: Naturally balancing work across available resources

## Basic Pattern

```go
func fanOut(input <-chan Task, workers int) {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    // Start workers
    wg.Add(workers)
    for i := 0; i < workers; i++ {
        go func(workerID int) {
            defer wg.Done()
            for task := range input {
                // Process the task
                process(task, workerID)
            }
        }(i)
    }
    
    // Wait for all workers to finish
    wg.Wait()
}
```

## Use Cases

- **CPU-intensive tasks**: Distributing computationally expensive operations
- **I/O-bound operations**: Handling multiple I/O operations concurrently
- **Request processing**: Handling multiple client requests in parallel
- **Data processing**: Processing large datasets in chunks

## Variations

- **Fixed worker count**: Using a predetermined number of workers
- **Dynamic worker count**: Adjusting the number of workers based on load
- **Worker pool**: Reusing workers for different tasks
- **Priority-based**: Processing high-priority tasks first

## Challenges

- **Resource contention**: Workers competing for shared resources
- **Task distribution**: Ensuring fair distribution of tasks
- **Coordination**: Coordinating results from multiple workers
- **Error handling**: Managing errors from multiple goroutines

## Exercise Ideas

1. Implement a basic fan-out worker pool
2. Create an image processing system with multiple workers
3. Build a web crawler that distributes work across goroutines

## Best Practices

- Choose an appropriate number of workers based on available CPU cores
- Consider resource constraints when determining worker count
- Use buffered channels to smooth out workload peaks
- Implement proper cancellation mechanisms
- Collect and aggregate results using a fan-in pattern

## Common Mistakes

- Creating too many workers, causing excessive context switching
- Not handling panics in worker goroutines
- Forgetting to close channels properly
- Ignoring resource limitations
- Not considering the cost of task distribution

## Comparison with Fan-In

While Fan-Out distributes work to multiple goroutines, Fan-In consolidates results from multiple goroutines. They are often used together in a pipeline.

## Next Steps

After mastering fan-out, learn about worker pools for more controlled parallel execution.
