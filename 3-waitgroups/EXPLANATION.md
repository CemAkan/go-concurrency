# Web Crawler Explanation

## Overview

This project implements a concurrent **web crawler** in Go, designed to efficiently fetch and process multiple web pages in parallel. It leverages Go's concurrency primitives, including **goroutines** and **sync.WaitGroup**, to manage concurrent HTTP requests and ensure graceful completion.

---

## Core Features

- **Concurrent Fetching**: Multiple URLs are fetched concurrently to improve crawling speed.
- **WaitGroup Synchronization**: `sync.WaitGroup` is used to track and wait for all goroutines to complete before the program exits.
- **Modular Design**: Separate packages and files handle crawling logic, request handling, data storage, and configuration.
- **Error Handling & Retries**: Robust error handling ensures failed requests can be retried or logged appropriately.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily extendable to add features like URL filtering, depth control, or custom parsing.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**  
   Configuration and environment variables are loaded to define crawler parameters such as target URLs, concurrency limits, and timeout settings.

2. **Starting the Crawl**  
   The crawler reads initial seed URLs and spawns goroutines to fetch each URL concurrently.

3. **Managing Goroutines**  
   Each fetch operation runs in a separate goroutine. A shared `sync.WaitGroup` tracks all active goroutines, incremented on spawn and decremented on completion.

4. **Fetching & Parsing**  
   The crawler performs HTTP requests, processes response content, and extracts new links or relevant data as needed.

5. **Data Handling**  
   Extracted data is sent to storage or further processing pipelines (e.g., database insertion or file writing).

6. **Graceful Shutdown**  
   The main goroutine waits on the `WaitGroup` to ensure all fetch operations finish before exiting.

## Concurrency Model

- **Goroutines**: Lightweight threads for concurrent URL fetching.
- **sync.WaitGroup**: Synchronizes the main process with all spawned goroutines to prevent premature program exit.
- **Channels (optional)**: May be used to communicate results or tasks between goroutines (depending on project details).

---

## Benefits

- Efficient utilization of system resources by parallelizing network I/O.
- Safe and clean shutdown ensuring no fetch operation is left hanging.
- Scalability by adjusting concurrency parameters.
- Modular codebase facilitating maintenance and feature growth.

---

## Typical Use Cases

- Web scraping and data extraction.
- Monitoring and archiving web content.
- Automated testing of websites.
- SEO analysis and link discovery.

## File Structure (Example)

- `main.go`: Entry point; sets up environment, starts crawling.
- `crawler.go`: Core crawling logic and goroutine management.
- `crawl_handler.go`: HTTP request execution and response processing.
- `db.go`: Data storage handling (database interactions).
- `types.go`: Common data structures and types.
- `env.go`: Environment variable and configuration loading.
- `crawler.go`: May contain WaitGroup usage for goroutine synchronization.

## Summary

This Go web crawler project demonstrates an effective concurrency pattern utilizing goroutines and `sync.WaitGroup` to manage asynchronous network operations safely and efficiently. It highlights best practices in concurrent programming, modular design, and error resilience, making it a solid foundation for scalable web crawling tasks.
